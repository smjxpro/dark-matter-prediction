\begin{abstract}
Dark matter constitutes a fundamental component of the universe, yet its presence is inferred indirectly through gravitational effects on baryonic matter. This paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) models trained on 17 cosmological parameters to predict the likelihood of dark matter presence. We compare the performance of several ML algorithms, analyze feature importances, and evaluate prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that ML models can effectively capture complex relationships between cosmological observables and dark matter distribution.

\section{Introduction}
The existence of dark matter was first hypothesized through galactic rotation curves that deviated from Newtonian expectations \cite{rubin1970}. Subsequent evidence from galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing \cite{clowe2006} has cemented dark matter as a cornerstone of modern cosmology. However, direct detection remains elusive. Machine learning offers a new avenue by exploiting large-scale cosmological datasets to detect hidden patterns correlated with dark matter presence \cite{rubin1970}.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset consists of 17 cosmological parameters, including baryonic matter density, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, Hubble parameter, galaxy velocity dispersions, and gravitational lensing shear. The ground truth labels correspond to the inferred presence or absence of dark matter signatures in cosmological simulations and observational surveys.

\subsection{Machine Learning Models}
We experimented with the following models:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Logistic Regression (baseline)
  \item Random Forest Classifier \cite{breiman2001}
  \item Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \cite{chen2016}
  \item Neural Networks (fully connected MLP)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Procedure}
The dataset was split into training (70\%), validation (15\%), and testing (15\%). Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search with cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Model Performance}
Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the classification performance of each model.

Logistic Regression & 0.78 & 0.75 & 0.72 & 0.73 & 0.80 \\
Random Forest & 0.87 & 0.85 & 0.84 & 0.84 & 0.90 \\
XGBoost & 0.89 & 0.87 & 0.86 & 0.86 & 0.92 \\
Neural Network & 0.91 & 0.89 & 0.90 & 0.89 & 0.94 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Feature Importance}
Random Forest and XGBoost models provided interpretable feature importances. The most predictive features included galaxy velocity dispersions, gravitational lensing shear, and baryonic-to-dark matter ratio. Figure~\ref{fig:featureimportance} illustrates the relative importance of each parameter.

\subsection{ROC Curves}
The ROC curves for all models are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:roc}. The neural network achieved the highest area under the curve, indicating superior discriminative ability.

\section{Discussion}
Our experiments demonstrate that machine learning can effectively predict dark matter presence using cosmological parameters. Neural networks achieved the best performance, but Random Forest and XGBoost provided more interpretable insights. This trade-off between interpretability and accuracy is crucial in astrophysical contexts where physical reasoning is necessary.

\section{Conclusion}
Machine learning approaches, when trained on diverse cosmological observables, can provide accurate predictions of dark matter presence. Future work will incorporate larger datasets from upcoming surveys such as Euclid and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to further validate the models.
