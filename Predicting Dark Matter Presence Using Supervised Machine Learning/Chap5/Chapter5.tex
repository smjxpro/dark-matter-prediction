\section{Conclusion}
Dark matter is the dominant mystery of todayâ€™s astrophysics and cosmology. It is invisible as it cannot be detected by indirect means, and we instead infer its existence from the effect of gravity on visible matter like galaxies and galaxy clusters. Through the observation of cosmic structures (such as galaxy-wide rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the first acoustic peak in the CMB), scientists' estimates for dark matter changed to approximately 27\% of mass-energy content. But it is not clear what exactly, with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions and sterile neutrinos, some of the most likely candidates.

Much progress has been made and new technologies have been developed over the years, but dark matter, mapped in detail or detected directly, remains elusive, resisting all particle physics and cosmological theories to date. Understanding dark matter is important not just for understanding how the universe is built, but also for revealing the very substance of physics at its deepest scale.

\section{Limitation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quality and Availability of Data:}Reliance on good quality data being available, many cosmic surveys can limit accuracy.

    \item \textbf{Computation Constraints:} Precise models require large amount of computation resources, thus cannot be scalable.

    \item \textbf{Dependence on the Model:} Not all nuances of sequences might be optimally captured by models, in particular with noisy or scarce data.

    \item \textbf{Generalisation: }The results might be dataset dependent and not applicable for any analysis of dark matter.
\end{itemize}


 
\section{Potential Improvements}
Enhanced Detection Techniques: Increasing the sensitivity and resolution of detectors for detecting dark matter will be critical for observing a rare interaction between dark matter particles and ordinary matter. Advances in cryogenic detectors, liquid xenon detectors and high energy particle accelerators may offer the next leap in direct detection.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Better Data From Space: Observatories in space, like the James Webb Space Telescope and the upcoming LISA mission, might provide more information about how dark matter is distributed in the cosmos and how it interacts with ordinary matter. Sharper observations of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing will better map dark matter in the future.

    \item Interdisciplinary Methods Jointly studying particle physics, astronomy, and cosmology will help achieve more comprehensive insights into dark matter. Cooperation between theoretical physicists and observational astronomers will be crucial for testing the current hypotheses and even to provide new models of dark matter.

    \item Alternative Theories and Models Continuing to explore alternative theories of dark matter can serve two purposes toward the goal of gaining more insight into its nature: one is to constrain or rule out such models, and the other is an opportunity for discovering new physics.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
In summary, although dark matter remains a persistent enigma, there are reasons for optimism as improved detection technology, theoretical modeling and observations continue to improve the prospects for major discoveries in the coming years. It can be expected that a determination of the nature of dark matter will have far-reaching consequences for both cosmology and particle physics, altering our conception of the universe.
