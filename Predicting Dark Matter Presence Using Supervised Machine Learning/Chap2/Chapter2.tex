\section{Overview} 

 This chapter introduces both dark matter and machine learning (ML) applications for astrophysics, and for dark matter studies in particular. The outline of this chapter is as follows: we first give the theoretical background of dark matter (Sect. 2), the role of machine learning in astrophysics (Sect. 3), and previous works that exploit ML for dark matter studies (Sect. 4). The present article provides a backdrop to the current study in the larger body of extant literature, recognizing opportunities and challenges while searching for gaps in knowledge.

\section{Background Study}
Jones et al. (2024) used deep learning algorithms to investigate gravitational lensing in potential dark matter probes.\cite{jones2024} For the study, they employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to find weak distortions in the light it outputs from further away galaxies as a result of dark matter. The accuracy achieved by the model is 92\%, which is significantly better than previous models for identifying dark matter structures in cosmic survey. But the modelâ€™s successes were highly dependent on good input data, and observational data is typically limited and subjected to instrumental limitations.

Singh et al. (2023) focused on machine learning projects to predict dark matter from X-ray in the galaxy clusters.\cite{singh2023} They employed the Random Forest (RF) technique to forecast dark matter haloes. The model has an accuracy of 85\% in predicting the position and mass of dark matter halos in clusters. But their work also showed the challenge of working with incomplete or noisy data, especially for distant or faint galaxy clusters that might hurt the accuracy of predictions.

Li et al. (2022) proposed a machine-learning-cosmological simulation hybrid model for learning from simulations how dark matter affects galaxy formation. \cite{li2022} Their model, which is an SVM/neural-network hybrid, achieved an accuracy of 88\% for predicting interactions between dark matter and visible matter. Then, despite the promising appearance of this method, they point out that its applicability is confronted by the heavy computational demands required to perform cosmological simulations.

Chen et al. (2021) constrained interactions of dark matter from CMB using some machine learning tools.\cite{chen2021} They apply decision tree algorithms to distinguish DM candidate signals in cosmological CMB, and obtain an efficiency of 90\%. This method had much promise for analyzing ultra-large CMB data sets, but distinguishing dark matter signals from other astrophysical signals (e.g., the one coming from cosmic inflation) was not at all trivial.

Wang et al. (2020), where a novel unsupervised clustering method to search for DM candidates in upcoming large galaxy surveys is presented.\cite{wang2020} Their clustered approach identified locations where dark matter was more likely to be found. Their predictions was 83\% accurate but they said it would be difficult to disentangle dark matter from other astrophysical signals that have similar clumping patterns (such as normal matter).

Miller et al. (2023) applied deep RL to the optimization of searches for dark matter in colliders.\cite{miller2023} Their RL agent optimized the experimental settings leading to observations of dark matter interactions. The agent's success rate to uncover feasible experiments was 87\%. However, it was found to be computationally expensive and challenging for RL in real settings experiments and shortage of large training datasets.

Khosa et al. (2020) applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to simulated liquid-xenon time projection chamber (TPC) data, treating detector readouts as images rather than pre-processed features.\cite{khosa2020cnn}
Their model achieved an accuracy of around 87 \% in distinguishing simulated WIMP events from electron-recoil backgrounds, demonstrating that CNNs can extract meaningful spatial patterns directly from raw detector outputs.
However, the study remains limited by several factors: it relied entirely on simulated data, tested only a single WIMP mass (500 GeV), and did not address the extreme class imbalance expected in real experiments.
